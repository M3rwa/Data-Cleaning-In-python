# Data Cleaning in Python

This repository contains code and examples for data cleaning in Python. Data cleaning is an essential step in the data preparation process, which involves identifying and handling missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, and other data quality issues to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.

## Project Description

The main focus of this project is to demonstrate various techniques and approaches for cleaning and preprocessing datasets using Python. It covers common data cleaning tasks and provides code snippets and examples to guide you through the process.

The project covers the following topics:

1. Handling missing values: Learn how to identify missing values in a dataset and handle them using techniques such as imputation, deletion, or interpolation.

2. Removing outliers: Discover methods to detect and handle outliers, which are extreme or unusual observations that can impact the analysis and model performance.

3. Dealing with inconsistencies: Explore techniques to identify and resolve inconsistencies in the data, such as inconsistent formatting, typos, or inconsistent values.

4. Data normalization and scaling: Learn about techniques to normalize or scale the data, ensuring that variables are on a similar scale for accurate analysis.

5. Handling categorical variables: Understand different approaches to encode categorical variables, including one-hot encoding, label encoding, and ordinal encoding.

6. Data validation and quality checks: Implement data validation techniques to identify and handle data quality issues, such as duplicate records or inconsistent data types.
